# Known Limitations

Mooncake.jl has a number of known qualitative limitations, which we document here.

## Coverage of Julia Syntax and Standard Library

While `Mooncake.jl` should now work on a very large subset of the language, there remain things that you should expect not to work. A non-exhaustive list of things to bear in mind includes:
1. It is always necessary to produce hand-written rules for `ccall`s (and, more generally, foreigncall nodes). We have rules for many `ccall`s, but not all. If you encounter a foreigncall without a hand-written rule, you should get an informative error message which tells you what is going on and how to deal with it.
1. Builtins which require rules. The vast majority of them have rules now, but some don't. You should get a sensible error if you encounter a primitive without a rule.
1. Anything involving tasks / threading -- we have no thread safety guarantees and, at the time of writing, I'm not entirely sure what error you will find if you attempt to AD through code which uses Julia's task / thread system. The same applies to distributed computing. These limitations ought to be possible to resolve.

## `try`/`catch`/`finally` Blocks

Mooncake.jl does not support differentiating through `try`/`catch` or `try`/`finally` blocks
in **reverse mode**. Attempting to do so will produce an `UnhandledLanguageFeatureException`
with a message explaining the cause. Forward mode does support these constructs.

**The fix** is to replace `try`/`catch` blocks with explicit conditional checks where possible.
For example:

```julia
# Does not work with Mooncake
function safe_log(x)
    try
        return log(x)
    catch e
        return -Inf
    end
end

# Works with Mooncake
function safe_log(x)
    x <= 0 && return -Inf
    return log(x)
end
```

If the `try`/`catch` block cannot be avoided (e.g. it lives inside a third-party library), the
alternative is to provide a custom `rrule!!` for the function that contains the `try`/`catch`
block, so that Mooncake never needs to differentiate through the block itself.
See [Defining Rules](@ref) for guidance on writing custom rules.

## Mutation of Global Variables

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using Mooncake
    using Mooncake: NoTangent, build_rrule
end
```

While great care is taken in this package to prevent silent errors, this is one edge case that we have yet to provide a satisfactory solution for.
Consider a function of the form:
```jldoctest bad_globalref
julia> const x = Ref(1.0);

julia> function foo(y::Float64)
           x[] = y
           return x[]
       end
foo (generic function with 1 method)
```
`x` is a global variable (if you refer to it in your code, it appears as a `GlobalRef` in the AST or lowered code).
For some technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this section, this package cannot propagate gradient information through `x`.
`foo` is the identity function, so it should have gradient `1.0`.
However, if you differentiate this example, you'll see:
```jldoctest bad_globalref
julia> rule = Mooncake.build_rrule(foo, 2.0);

julia> Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!(rule, foo, 2.0)
(2.0, (NoTangent(), 0.0))
```
Observe that while it has correctly computed the identity function, the gradient is zero.

The takeaway: do not attempt to differentiate functions which modify global state. Reading globals is fine; mutating globals is not.


## Passing Differentiable Data as a Type

Credit goes to Guillaume Dalle for noticing this limitation.

This is an example of a known silent correctness issue.
```jldoctest
julia> struct T{x} end

julia> @noinline getparam(::T{x}) where {x} = x
getparam (generic function with 1 method)

julia> mysquare(x) = getparam(T{x}())^2
mysquare (generic function with 1 method)

julia> cache = Mooncake.prepare_derivative_cache(mysquare, 3.0);

julia> Mooncake.value_and_derivative!!(cache, Mooncake.zero_dual(mysquare), Mooncake.Dual(3.0, 1.0))
Mooncake.Dual{Float64, Float64}(9.0, 0.0)
```
As you can see, the tangent is `0.0` rather than `6.0`.

However, we view this as a pathological use of Julia's language features, and believe it is unlikely to cause trouble in practice.
If you encounter a practical situation in which it is very important that this example work correctly, please open an issue.

## Primitives and Overlays

[`@mooncake_overlay`](@ref Mooncake.@mooncake_overlay) and [`@is_primitive`](@ref Mooncake.@is_primitive) both let you change what Mooncake sees when it differentiates a function, but they hook in at different layers and do not compose.
`@mooncake_overlay` swaps in a replacement body Mooncake walks through; `@is_primitive` stops Mooncake walking and dispatches to a hand-written rule instead.
Marking a signature as a primitive shadows any overlay reachable through it — the rule fires, the overlay does not, and Mooncake infers return types from the original method, not from the overlay.

This causes two failure modes:

1. **An overlay that changes the return type breaks the rule's return-type contract.**
   Mooncake infers the return type from the original method, so a manual rule that returns a value of the overlaid type produces a `CoDual` that disagrees with that inferred type, triggering a runtime `TypeError`.
   When the original and overlaid methods return the same type, the runtime check is trivially satisfied and the bug surfaces only as an incorrect gradient.

2. **An overlay inside a primitive's body never runs.**
   The rule replaces the body and runs the primal through ordinary Julia dispatch, which ignores overlays.
   An overlay introduced to work around unsupported code reached from inside the primitive is silently inert — move it to a signature Mooncake still differentiates, or fold the workaround into the rule.

The example below covers both cases.
Case (1) overlays the primitive itself; case (2) overlays a helper called from the primitive's body.
Each identity check asks whether Mooncake's inferred return type for the caller is `A` (the original) rather than `B` (what the overlay would produce):

```jldoctest overlay-primitive-doctest
julia> struct A end

julia> struct B end

julia> direct_primitive(::A) = A()
direct_primitive (generic function with 1 method)

julia> Mooncake.@mooncake_overlay direct_primitive(::A) = B()

julia> Mooncake.@is_primitive Mooncake.DefaultCtx Mooncake.ReverseMode Tuple{typeof(direct_primitive), A}

julia> helper(::A) = A()
helper (generic function with 1 method)

julia> Mooncake.@mooncake_overlay helper(::A) = B()

julia> indirect_primitive(x::A) = helper(x)
indirect_primitive (generic function with 1 method)

julia> Mooncake.@is_primitive Mooncake.DefaultCtx Mooncake.ReverseMode Tuple{typeof(indirect_primitive), A}

julia> caller_direct(x::A) = direct_primitive(x)
caller_direct (generic function with 1 method)

julia> caller_indirect(x::A) = indirect_primitive(x)
caller_indirect (generic function with 1 method)

julia> interp = Mooncake.MooncakeInterpreter(Mooncake.DefaultCtx, Mooncake.ReverseMode);

julia> Base.code_ircode_by_type(Tuple{typeof(caller_direct), A}; interp)[1][2] === A
true

julia> Base.code_ircode_by_type(Tuple{typeof(caller_indirect), A}; interp)[1][2] === A
true
```

Mooncake infers `A` for both callers, even though the overlays would produce a `B` — so any rule written against the overlay's return type fails the runtime check.
Apply only one of `@mooncake_overlay` or `@is_primitive` to a given signature, and make sure no overlay you rely on sits behind a primitive's rule.

## Differentiating CUDA Kernels

Mooncake.jl supports differentiation of CUDA kernels in general, provided a suitable rule exists. However, it does not support kernels that surface as foreign calls, such as those generated via KernelAbstractions.jl (see [issue #648](https://github.com/chalk-lab/Mooncake.jl/issues/648) and [issue #835](https://github.com/chalk-lab/Mooncake.jl/issues/835)). Support for these foreign-call kernels is outside the scope of the project and is considered a non-goal.

Users who need to differentiate through these code paths may do so by providing a custom rule, potentially generated with the assistance of another automatic differentiation tool (cf. [this comment](https://github.com/chalk-lab/Mooncake.jl/issues/648#issuecomment-3058010288)).

## Differentiating SIMD Code

When the primal code admits SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimisations by the LLVM compiler, reverse-mode automatic differentiation in Mooncake can inhibit LLVM's ability to apply the same optimisations. This occurs because the transformations introduced during differentiation may obscure the structural patterns that LLVM relies on for vectorisation.

Consequently, code that performs well in its primal form may suffer substantial slowdowns after differentiation. In performance-critical regions, this can often be mitigated by providing hand-written derivative rules (`rrule!!`s, see [Defining Rules](@ref)). Such rules allow explicit control over the structure of the adjoint computation and can be used to preserve SIMD-friendly loop forms.

If you observe unexpected performance regressions in differentiated code that is known to vectorise effectively in its primal form, consider implementing custom rules for the relevant operations. For example, a customised performance-oriented rule is added for `kron` in Mooncake ([PR #886](https://github.com/chalk-lab/Mooncake.jl/pull/886)) to address the loss of SIMD vectorisation that arises when differentiating the SIMD-friendly primal implementation of `kron` in Julia's standard library ([LinearAlgebra implementation](https://github.com/JuliaLang/LinearAlgebra.jl/blob/b1f48a442ba5f41479d4fb6f3e931b1ac2f21059/src/dense.jl#L499-L531)).

## Circular References in Type Declarations

Mooncake.jl's default `tangent_type` implementation cannot support types which refer to themselves either directly or indirectly in their definition.
Below is an example in which a type refers to itself directly in its definition.

_**The Problem**_

Suppose that you have a type such as:
```julia
mutable struct A
    x::Float64
    a::A
    function A(x::Float64)
        a = new(x)
        a.a = a
        return a
    end
end
```

This is a fairly canonical example of a self-referential type.
There are a couple of things which will not work with it out-of-the-box.
`tangent_type(A)` will produce a stack overflow error.
To see this, note that it will in effect try to produce a tangent of type `Tangent{Tuple{tangent_type(A)}}` -- the circular dependency on the `tangent_type` function causes real problems here.

_**The Solution**_

In order to resolve this, you need to produce a tangent type by hand.
You might go with something like
```julia
mutable struct TangentForA
    x::Float64 # tangent type for Float64 is Float64
    a::TangentForA
    function TangentForA(x::Float64)
        a = new(x)
        a.a = a
        return a
    end
end
```
The point here is that you can manually resolve the circular dependency using a data structure which mimics the primal type.
You will, however, need to implement similar methods for `zero_tangent`, `randn_tangent`, etc, and presumably need to implement additional `getfield` and `setfield` rules which are specific to this type.
An example implementation of this is provided [here](developer_documentation/custom_tangent_type.md).

## Tangent Generation and Pointers

_**The Problem**_


In many use cases, a pointer provides the address of the start of a block of memory which has been allocated to e.g. store an array.
However, we cannot get any of this context from the pointer itself -- by just looking at a pointer, I cannot know whether its purpose is to refer to the start of a large block of memory, some proportion of the way through a block of memory, or even to keep track of a single address.

Recall that the tangent to a pointer is another pointer:
```jldoctest
julia> Mooncake.tangent_type(Ptr{Float64})
Ptr{Float64}
```
Plainly I cannot implement a method of `zero_tangent` for `Ptr{Float64}` because I don't know how much memory to allocate.

This is, however, fine if a pointer appears half way through a function, having been derived from another data structure. e.g.
```jldoctest
function foo(x::Vector{Float64})
    p = pointer(x, 2)
    return unsafe_load(p)
end

rule = build_rrule(Tuple{typeof(foo), Vector{Float64}})
Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!(rule, foo, [5.0, 4.0])

# output
(4.0, (NoTangent(), [0.0, 1.0]))
```

_**The Solution**_

This is only really a problem for tangent / fdata / rdata generation functionality, such as `zero_tangent`.
As a work-around, AD testing functionality permits users to pass in `CoDual`s.
So if you are testing something involving a pointer, you will need to construct its tangent yourself, and pass a `CoDual` to e.g. `Mooncake.TestUtils.test_rule`.

While pointers tend to be a low-level implementation detail in Julia code, you could in principle actually be interested in differentiating a function of a pointer.
In this case, you will not be able to use `Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!` as this requires the use of `zero_tangent`.
Instead, you will need to use lower-level (internal) functionality, such as `Mooncake.__value_and_gradient!!`, or use the rule interface directly.

Honestly, your best bet is just to avoid differentiating functions whose arguments are pointers if you can.
