# Tutorial

There are two ways to compute gradients with Mooncake.jl:

- through the standardised [DifferentiationInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/DifferentiationInterface.jl) API
- through the native Mooncake.jl API

We recommend the former to start with, especially if you want to experiment with other automatic differentiation packages.

```julia
import DifferentiationInterface as DI
import Mooncake
```

## DifferentiationInterface.jl API

DifferentiationInterface.jl (or DI for short) provides a common entry point for every automatic differentiation package in Julia.
To specify that you want to use Mooncake.jl, just create the right "backend" object (with an optional [`Mooncake.Config`](@ref)):

```julia
backend = DI.AutoMooncake(; config=nothing)
```

This object is actually defined by a third package called [ADTypes.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ADTypes.jl), but re-exported by DI.

### Friendly tangents

By default, Mooncake will use internal types such as `Mooncake.Tangent` to represent tangents
(gradients or derivatives) of most Julia types (e.g. complex numbers, symmetric matrices).
To represent tangents using the same types as the original function,
such that the tangent of a `ComplexF64` is a `ComplexF64`,
or the tangent of a `Symmetric` is a `Symmetric`,
set `friendly_tangents=true` in the config:

```julia
backend = DI.AutoMooncake(; config=Mooncake.Config(; friendly_tangents=true))
```

### Single argument

Suppose you want to differentiate the following function

```julia
f(x) = sum(abs2, x)
```

on the following input

```julia
x = float.(1:3)
```

The naive way is to simply call [`DI.gradient`](@extref DifferentiationInterface.gradient):

```julia
DI.gradient(f, backend, x)  # slow, do not do this
```

This returns the correct gradient, but it is very slow because it includes the time taken by Mooncake.jl to compute a differentiation rule for `f` (see [Mooncake.jl's Rule System](@ref)).
If you anticipate you will need more than one gradient, it is better to call [`DI.prepare_gradient`](@extref DifferentiationInterface.prepare_gradient) on a typical (e.g. random) input first:

```julia
typical_x = rand(3)
prep = DI.prepare_gradient(f, backend, typical_x)
```

The typical input should have the same size and type as the actual inputs we will provide later on.
As for the contents of the preparation result, they do not matter.
What matters is that it captures everything you need for `DI.gradient` to be fast:

```julia
DI.gradient(f, prep, backend, x)  # fast
```

For optimal speed, you can provide storage space for the gradient and call [`DI.gradient!`](@extref DifferentiationInterface.gradient!) instead:

```julia
grad = similar(x)
DI.gradient!(f, grad, prep, backend, x)  # very fast
```

If you also need the value of the function, check out [`DI.value_and_gradient`](@extref DifferentiationInterface.value_and_gradient) or [`DI.value_and_gradient!`](@extref DifferentiationInterface.value_and_gradient!):

```julia
DI.value_and_gradient(f, prep, backend, x)
```

### Multiple arguments

What should you do if your function takes more than one input argument?
Well, DI can still handle it, _assuming that you only want the derivative with respect to one of them_ (the first one, by convention).
For instance, consider the function

```julia
g(x, a, b) = a * f(x) + b
```

You can easily compute the gradient with respect to `x`, while keeping `a` and `b` fixed.
To do that, just wrap these two arguments inside [`DI.Constant`](@extref DifferentiationInterface.Constant), like so:

```julia
typical_a, typical_b = 1.0, 1.0
prep = DI.prepare_gradient(g, backend, typical_x, DI.Constant(typical_a), DI.Constant(typical_b))

a, b = 42.0, 3.14
DI.value_and_gradient(g, prep, backend, x, DI.Constant(a), DI.Constant(b))
```

Note that this works even when you change the value of `a` or `b` (those are not baked into the preparation result).

If one of your additional arguments behaves like a scratch space in memory (instead of a meaningful constant), you can use [`DI.Cache`](@extref DifferentiationInterface.Cache) instead.

Now what if you care about the derivatives with respect to every argument?
You can always go back to the single-argument case by putting everything inside a tuple:

```julia
g_tup(xab) = xab[2] * f(xab[1]) + xab[3]
prep = DI.prepare_gradient(g_tup, backend, (typical_x, typical_a, typical_b))
DI.value_and_gradient(g_tup, prep, backend, (x, a, b))
```

You can also use the native API of Mooncake.jl, discussed below.

### Beyond gradients

Going through DI allows you to compute other kinds of derivatives, like (reverse-mode) Jacobian matrices.
The syntax is very similar:

```julia
h(x) = cos.(x) .* sin.(reverse(x))
prep = DI.prepare_jacobian(h, backend, x)
DI.jacobian(h, prep, backend, x)
```

## Mooncake.jl API

```@example mooncake_api
import Mooncake
```

### Mooncake.jl Functions

Mooncake.jl provides the following core differentiation functions:

- **Forward mode**: `Mooncake.value_and_derivative!!` - computes function value and the Frechet derivative
- **Reverse mode**: `Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!` - computes function value and gradient (when output is scalar)  
- **Reverse mode**: `Mooncake.value_and_pullback!!` - computes function value and pullback (general case)

### Terminology Comparison with DifferentiationInterface.jl

Mooncake.jl discusses Frechet derivatives and their adjoints, as described in detail in [Algorithmic Differentiation](@ref). This differs from the conventions used by [DifferentiationInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/DifferentiationInterface.jl) and some other AD packages.

**General cases:**

- **Frechet derivative**: In forward mode, Mooncake computes the Frechet derivative `D f[x]`, which maps tangent vectors to tangent vectors. This corresponds to what DifferentiationInterface refers to as a "pushforward", and is implemented in `Mooncake.value_and_derivative!!`. 

- **Adjoint of derivative and pullback**: In reverse mode, Mooncake computes the adjoint `D f[x]*` of the Frechet derivative, which maps cotangent vectors backwards through the computation. This corresponds to what DifferentiationInterface calls a "pullback" and is implemented in `Mooncake.value_and_pullback!!`.

**Special cases (scalar input/output):**

- **Derivative**: When the input is scalar, the Frechet derivative `f'(x) = D f[x](v)` with `v = 1` gives the ordinary derivative. This corresponds to `DI.derivative`, while Mooncake lacks an equivalent API and handles this as a special case of `Mooncake.value_and_derivative!!`. 

- **Gradient**: When the output is scalar, the adjoint of the derivative applied to `1` gives the gradient `∇f`. This corresponds to `DI.gradient` and is implemented in `Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!`.

### Single Argument

```@example mooncake_api
f(x) = sum(abs2, x)
x = float.(1:3)

# Prepare the differentiation rule once (handles compilation)
cache = Mooncake.prepare_gradient_cache(f, x)

# Compute value and gradient (fast on repeated calls)
val, (_, grad) = Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!(cache, f, x)
(val, grad)
```

### Multiple Arguments

To differentiate with respect to all arguments, pack them into a tuple:

```@example mooncake_api
g(xab) = xab[2] * f(xab[1]) + xab[3]
a, b = 2.0, 3.0
cache_g = Mooncake.prepare_gradient_cache(g, (x, a, b))
val_g, (_, grad_g) = Mooncake.value_and_gradient!!(cache_g, g, (x, a, b))
(val_g, grad_g)
```
