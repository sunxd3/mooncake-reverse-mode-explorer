The goal of the `Mooncake.jl` project is to produce an AD package written entirely in Julia that improves on `ForwardDiff.jl`, `ReverseDiff.jl`, and `Zygote.jl` in several ways.
Please refer to [the docs](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/dev) for more info.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Mooncake.jl` is maintained primarily by academic researchers at grant-funded
> institutions, with correspondingly limited capacity for triage and review. In the spirit of
> long-lived projects such as R and TeX, we favour correctness, stability,
> and tightly scoped fixes over open-ended expansion.
>
> Contributions are most welcome when they concern reproducible defects:
> incorrect results, unexpected failures, or behaviour at odds with the
> documented scope. Feature requests, redesign proposals, and debugging
> queries lacking a minimal reproducible example sit outside what we can
> reasonably support, as do requests for rules beyond Julia Base, or for
> behaviour noted on the [known limitations](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/stable/known_limitations/)
> page; such issues will generally be closed.
>
> Organisations relying on Mooncake.jl commercially are warmly encouraged
> to contribute, whether through focused code contributions, financial
> support, or both.

## Getting Started

Check that you're running a version of Julia that Mooncake.jl supports.
See the `SUPPORT_POLICY.md` file for more info.

There are several ways to interact with `Mooncake.jl`. To interact directly with `Mooncake.jl`, use Mooncake's native API, which allows reuse of prepared caches for repeated gradient and Hessian evaluations:

```julia
import Mooncake as MC

f(x) = (1 - x[1])^2 + 100 * (x[2] - x[1]^2)^2  # Rosenbrock
x = [1.2, 1.2]

# Reverse mode
grad_cache = MC.prepare_gradient_cache(f, x);
val, grad = MC.value_and_gradient!!(grad_cache, f, x)

# Forward mode
fwd_cache = MC.prepare_derivative_cache(f, x);
val_fwd, grad_fwd = MC.value_and_gradient!!(fwd_cache, f, x)

# Hessian
hess_cache = MC.prepare_hessian_cache(f, x);
val, grad, H = MC.value_gradient_and_hessian!!(hess_cache, f, x)
# val  : f(x)
# grad : ∇f(x)  (length-n vector)
# H    : ∇²f(x) (n×n matrix)
```

You should expect that `MC.prepare_*_cache` take a little time to run, but that subsequent gradient and hessian calls using the prepared caches are fast. For details, see the [interface docs](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/stable/interface/).
