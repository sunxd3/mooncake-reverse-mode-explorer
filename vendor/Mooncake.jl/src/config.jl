Configuration struct for use with `ADTypes.AutoMooncake`.

# Keyword Arguments
- `debug_mode::Bool=false`: whether or not to run additional type checks when
    differentiating a function. This has considerable runtime overhead, and should only be
    switched on if you are trying to debug something that has gone wrong in Mooncake.
- `silence_debug_messages::Bool=false`: if `false` and `debug_mode` is `true`, Mooncake will
    display some warnings that debug mode is enabled, in order to help prevent accidentally
    leaving debug mode on. If you wish to disable these messages, set this to `true`.
- `friendly_tangents::Bool=false`: if `true`, Mooncake will represent tangents using the
    primal type at the interface level: the tangent type of a primal type `P` will be `P`
    when using friendly tangents, and `tangent_type(P)` otherwise (e.g. the friendly tangent of a
    custom struct will be of the same type as the struct instead of Mooncake's `Tangent` type).
    The tangent is converted from/to the friendly representation at the interface level,
    so all Mooncake internal computations and rule implementations always use the
    [`tangent_type`](@ref) representation.
- `chunk_size::Union{Nothing,Int}=nothing`: optional chunk width for the public
    `prepare_derivative_cache` / `value_and_gradient!!` forward-mode path. `nothing` uses
    Mooncake's default chunking heuristic. This does not affect reverse-mode caches.
- `enable_nfwd::Bool=true`: whether prepared forward-mode caches may use the `nfwd`
    NDual-backed fast path. Setting this to `false` forces the `frule!!` (aka ir-based
    forward) path in `prepare_derivative_cache` and APIs layered on top of it, such as
    `prepare_hvp_cache` and `prepare_hessian_cache`. When left enabled, cache
    construction stays passive, but `value_and_derivative!!` / `value_and_gradient!!`
    may still error at runtime if `nfwd` turns out not to support the function.
- `empty_cache::Bool=false`: if `true`, all internal Mooncake caches (compiled OpaqueClosures,
    CodeInstances, and type-inference results) are cleared before building the new rule. This
    allows the garbage collector to reclaim memory held by previously compiled rules, and is
    useful in long-running sessions where many distinct functions have been differentiated.
    Note that only Julia-level (GC-managed) objects are freed; JIT-compiled native machine
    code is held permanently by the Julia runtime and cannot be reclaimed.
