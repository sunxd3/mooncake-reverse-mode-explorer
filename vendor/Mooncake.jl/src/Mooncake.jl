    frule!!(f::Dual, x::Dual...)

Performs AD in forward mode, possibly modifying the inputs, and returns a `Dual`.

"""
    _fcache_derivative_chunked!!(
        cache, ::Val{N}, x_dx::Tuple...; friendly_tangents=false
    )

Internal batched forward-mode interface used by chunked `value_and_derivative!!` and the
forward-mode gradient cache. Conceptually:
- `value_and_derivative!!` calls `_fcache_derivative_chunked!!` when the
  user provides chunk tangents.
- `value_and_gradient!!` seeds standard-basis chunk tangents internally, then repeatedly
  calls `_fcache_derivative_chunked!!` and accumulates the lane
  contributions into gradient buffers.

The generic implementation evaluates one lane at a time via `frule!!` (aka ir-based
forward) / derived forward rules. Specialized backends, such as `nfwd`, may override this
to evaluate all lanes in one pass.
"""
function _fcache_derivative_chunked!! end

"""
    build_primitive_frule(sig::Type{<:Tuple})

Construct an frule for signature `sig`. For this function to be called in `build_frule`, you
must also ensure that a method of `_is_primitive(context_type, ForwardMode, sig)` exists,
preferably by using the [@is_primitive](@ref) macro.
The callable returned by this must obey the frule interface, but there are no restrictions
on the type of callable itself. For example, you might return a callable `struct`. By
default, this function returns `frule!!` so, most of the time, you should just implement a
method of `frule!!`.

Mooncake's AD transform constructs primitive forward rules via this builder. However,
manual primitive call sites still exist in hand-written rules, tests, and docs, so direct
methods of `frule!!` may still be needed even when `build_primitive_frule` is defined.
Accordingly, when adding a new rule, it is still usually preferable to define `frule!!`
directly and only overload `build_primitive_frule` when you specifically need
construction-time work.

See also [`build_primitive_rrule`](@ref) for the reverse-mode analogue of this function.

# Extended Help

The purpose of this function is to permit computation at rule construction time, which can
be re-used at runtime. For example, you might wish to derive some information from `sig`
which you use at runtime (e.g. the fdata type of one of the arguments). While constant
propagation will often optimise this kind of computation away, it will sometimes fail to do
so in hard-to-predict circumstances. Consequently, if you need certain computations not to
happen at runtime in order to guarantee good performance, you might wish to e.g. emit a
callable `struct` with type parameters which are the result of this computation. In this
context, the motivation for using this function is the same as that of using staged
programming (e.g. via `@generated` functions) more generally.

"""
    rrule!!(f::CoDual, x::CoDual...)

Performs the forwards-pass of AD. The `tangent` field of `f` and each `x` should contain the
forwards tangent data (fdata) associated to each corresponding `primal` field.

Returns a 2-tuple.
The first element, `y`, is a `CoDual` whose `primal` field is the value associated to
running `f.primal(map(x -> x.primal, x)...)`, and whose `tangent` field is its associated
`fdata`.
The second element contains the pullback, which runs the reverse-pass. It maps from
the rdata associated to `y` to the rdata associated to `f` and each `x`.

```jldoctest
using Mooncake: zero_fcodual, CoDual, NoFData, rrule!!
y, pb!! = rrule!!(zero_fcodual(sin), CoDual(5.0, NoFData()))
pb!!(1.0)
